Tarmak is a toolkit for Kubernetes cluster provisioning and management. It
focuses on best practice cluster security and cluster management/operation. It
has been built to be cloud provider-agnostic and hence provides a means for
consistent and reliable cluster deployment and management, across clouds and
on-premise environments (metal/private cloud).

Tarmak uses a number of well known and proven components: terraform, puppet and
systemd.
