## What is Tarmak?

Tarmak is an open-source toolkit for Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management. It focuses on
best practice cluster security and cluster management/operation. It has been
built from the ground-up to be cloud provider-agnostic and hence provides a
means for consistent and reliable cluster deployment and management, across
clouds and on-premise environments.

Tarmak and its underlying components are the product of [Jetstack](https://www.jetstack.io)'s 
work with  its customers to build and deploy Kubernetes in production at scale.

Under-the-hood, Tarmak uses a number of well-known and proven components, 
including Terraform, Puppet and systemd.
